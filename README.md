# Clickable Links
Description:
An Azure DevOps web extension for displaying clickable href links on the work item form. The links are pulled from a user-configured backing field for the control that may be either visible or hidden.

Instructions:
- Install the custom control extension to your organization

- Add the control to your desired work item form group (i.e. Details)

- Configure your desired backing field for the control (i.e. Case Id)

- A clickable link will be created based upon your field's value when the work item loads

- The clickable link will be updated when the work item is saved or refreshed from the server

- Add multiple instances of the control if you want links from multiple backing fields

- That's it!
